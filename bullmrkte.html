      <p class="flow-text study-text">
        For branding, we wanted to focus on the idea that no matter what type of job market you must think like a bull.
        You must always be bullish for your career or else you will be left behind. Focus on what skills you can build and make sure you find something you love to do. The faster you find it in life the better.
